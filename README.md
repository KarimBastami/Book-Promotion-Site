# MammaMia - Book Promotion Site

My take on a single page book promotion type of website 

## Try It Without Downloading
[kb-mammamia.netlify.app](https://kb-mammamia.netlify.app)

## Main Features:
  - Fully responsive to all screen sizes (using bootstrap and custom media queries)
  - Collapsible text areas
  - Navbar links utilize scroll spy and smooth scrolling
  - Overall great look and feel to the site

## Tools used:
  - HTML/CSS
  - Bootstrap 4
  - Sass (for editing bootstrap source code)

## Disclaimer:
  - Used the lorem30 extension pack for Visual Studio Code to generate place holder blocks of text
